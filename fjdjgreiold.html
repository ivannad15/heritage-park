    <h2>A Walk Through Time</h2>
    <p>As we strolled through the well-maintained pathways, we couldn't help but appreciate the historical significance
      of this park. Each tree seemed to whisper stories of the past, and the vintage architecture scattered throughout
      added a unique charm.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsive Image:</strong> Here's a glimpse of the park on a sunny day, perfectly optimized for different
      screen sizes.</p>

    <p>With responsive design in mind, we wanted to ensure our readers have an optimal viewing experience, no matter the
      device. To achieve this, we used media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens.</p>

    <h3>Navigating Through Time</h3>
    <p>Exploring Heritage Park is like taking a journey through time. To enhance user experience, we've included
      navigation links that guide you to older posts.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Older Post 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Older Post 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Older Post 3</a></li>
